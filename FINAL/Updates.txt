Tiwtter Update

How to:

1. Copy Twitter Folder to the root of your theme
2. Remove the twitter call out from the head of your pages and replace it with the new one
	- Old: <script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/jquery.jtweetsanywhere-1.3.1.min.js"></script>
	- NEW: <script src="twitter/jquery.tweet.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
3. Remove the css in style1.css at the bottom and replace it with the new one
4. Replace app-head.js in javascripts folder with the new one. If you made changes to that file just replace the twitter call out.
5. In the footer where you have the div that holds the twitter 
<div id="tweetFeed"> </div> replace it with <div class="twitterfeed"></div>

All the files have now changed...you just need to configure your twitter script now
1. Go to app-head in javascript folder and replace the username and your website
2. Open index.php in the twitter folder and replace the info for App Consumer Key, App Consumer Secret, App Access Token and  App Access Token Secret with the ones that you get when you create your app on twitter at this page: https://apps.twitter.com/

Hope this is clear.

Cheers
